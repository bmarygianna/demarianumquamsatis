	<p>
		De Marianum Quam Satis translates loosely as “as much of Mary as is needful.” The journal began as
		a set of private notes kept after praying the Rosary during commutes, vigils, and pilgrimages. Over
		time those fragments asked to be shared—if only to encourage others who are learning to surrender
		their days to her care and, through her, to Christ.
	</p>
	<p>
		This space gathers short meditations, essays, and resources that explore how Marian devotion shapes
		a life lived in the modern Church. The writing balances tradition with personal experience: one foot
		in ancient prayers and the other planted in the immediacy of work, family, and civic life. When a
		post quotes Fathers, mystics, or poets, it does so in service of the same simple petition: “Show us
		Jesus.”
	</p>
	<p>
		You will encounter three recurring threads here:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Contemplation:</strong> Scriptural meditations and lectio divina prompts anchored in the
			mysteries of the Rosary.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Practice:</strong> Practical guides for building Marian rhythms at home, in parishes, and
			on the road.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Culture:</strong> Reviews and reflections on art, music, and literature that illuminate
			Marian themes in unexpected places.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Behind the journal is a lay Catholic who serves in parish ministry, spends too much time in used
		bookshops, and believes that Our Lady loves the quiet, hidden corners of ordinary days. If you would
		like to collaborate, submit a reflection, or simply share prayer intentions, please write to
